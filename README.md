## Project Odin first project: Recipes 
Use the basic knowledge I gained about html to create a basic recipe website. 

The website will contain a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The project will be re-visited in the future to add css and possibly js.

23-12-13 - Learned some basic CSS; returned to make the recipe site look a little bit better.
